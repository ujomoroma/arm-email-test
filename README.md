# ARM-Email-Test

## About
This project uses selenium to test sending and receiving an email using Yahoo! mail.

It validates that the sent message was received correctly by appending an identifier to the message to ensure that it is reading the correct message that was sent.

## How to run the test
1. Install [Node Js](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v14.17.3/) if you do not have it already installed.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`. This also installs Selenium Webdriver.
3. Install the appropriate [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) for you Chrome version.
4. Run the test using `npm run test`.
